### Helpful
Topics
- Many notes correct misinformation in a factual way with sources to back up their claims
- Topics: celebrities, current events, scientific facts, etc.
- A lot of the notes warn users of scams like phishing and giveaway scams
  - Incentive for a lot of people to mark this as helpful because it's not necessarily political or controversial

  - context behind images/videos/claims
  - background info
  - language/cultural context

OVERALL: Polarized notes were more negative, with the polarized right notes being the most negative, probably due to politics and controversial topics. Helpful and unhelpful were more neutral/negative leaning, with helpful notes containing the most neutral ones.

- Used VADER (found online that it's supposedly good for social media data because it does well with slang, emojis, etc.)
- Helpful
  - Highest proportion of neutral notes
  - Similar percentages of negative/positive/extremely negative
  - Majority of the sentiment isn't in the extremes
    - Even if notes are worded slightly positively/negatively, they are still marked as helpful if informative
- Unhelpful
  - Slightly less neutral and more negative/extremely negative but distributions still similar to helpful
  - Content probably has more of an impact than the tone
- Polarized Left
  - Highest percentage of extremely negative sentiment
  - Leans more negative than helpful/unhelpful and neutral: addressing more contentious topics so maybe due to disagreement with original tweet
- Polarized Right
  - Contains the most negative sentiment of all the groups: very critical/oppositional stance
  - Could also be due to the notes being more confrontational
- Center
  - middle ground-ish

  - convenient to cite info from wikipedia or link relevant videos

- Contains the most citations of the 4 main areas (other than center)
- 92% of these notes contained at least one citation

Unhelpful
- Least citations out of all of the notes
- 51% of notes contained citations
- Also contained google as one of the top 5 sources - people might have been relying on search results
  - Could be marked as unhelpful due to being generic
- Greater variety of sources, but not necessarily reliable sources

Polarized Left
- Good amount contain sources (75%)
- Contains more regionally specific sources
  - MHLW, Togetter from Japan
  - Globo from Brazil
  - Could be that more people from specific regions are submitting these notes than others

Polarized Right
- Good amount contain sources (78%)
- More health-related sources, like CDC,gov, NIH.gov
- Similar traditional news sources like Reuters, AP News, along with more politically-left leaning news sources like NY Times and The Guardian

- All of them had around the same readability
